# Poetry

Poetry is a tool that works in tandem with a virtual environment like `pyenv` to automatically handle library dependencies. So you don't have to stress about which version of, say, numpy, works with your given python version. 

It can be a little awkward to set up initially, but is well worth learning as this can be a nightmare sometimes and is commonly used in industry. You can install it using `pip` or their official installer. Most of the info in that page can be ignored and is for more advanced use.

We'll be using this to make sure we're both using the same python version and library versions.
